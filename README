Basic four dimensional renderer using glut/OpenGL in C++/Cg.

Not tuned for external users in terms of UI. Use qawsedftgyh for various kinds of movement or rotation in different dimensions.

Running:
make
./fourd

Todo list:
* Convert fourmath to use eigen code
** Re-add the 4d math that eigen doesn't provide through the addons approach detailed at http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicCustomizingEigen.html
* Refactor rotation code to be smoother
* Fix the 4d clipping issues (negative w?)
* Normalize the input amounts
* Refactor the input system
* Switch the mat4 class to be column major (at least make the calls explicit)
* Add heirarchical multi-view rendering that is based on eye structures
* Add post effects

Remnants of a Nehe starting tutorial are probably still around. Thanks!
Using a Makefile from Michael Crawford. Thanks!
