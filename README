Basic four dimensional renderer using glut/OpenGL in C++/Cg.

Not tuned for external users in terms of UI. Use qawsedftgyh for various kinds of movement or rotation in different dimensions.

Getting:
* Make sure you use --recursive on your clone command as this project uses submodules.
* If you already didn't do that, do this sequence:
** cd fourd
** git submodule init
** git submodule update

Running on Windows:
open up the sln in under ./project/, build

Running on Linux (haven't done this in a while, might be broken):
make
./fourd

Todo list:
* Add texturing
* Add Entity
* Setup scene structure
* Add collision
* Add 120 cell
* Add spin system
* Add lisp parser (ecl? clisp?)
* Add maxima
* Switch the mat4 class to be column major?
* Add text window with command entry

Remnants of a Nehe starting tutorial are probably still around. Thanks!
Using a Makefile from Michael Crawford. Thanks!
