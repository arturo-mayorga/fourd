Basic four dimensional renderer using glut/OpenGL in C++/Cg.

Not tuned for external users in terms of UI. Use qawsedftgyh for various kinds of movement or rotation in different dimensions.

Getting:
* Make sure you use --recurive on your clone command as this project uses submodules.
* If you already didn't do that, do this sequence:
** cd fourd
** git submodule init
** git submodule update

Running:
make
./fourd

Todo list:
* Fix non-ortho projection.
* Get shader reloading to work
* Switch the mat4 class to be column major? (at least make the calls explicit)

Remnants of a Nehe starting tutorial are probably still around. Thanks!
Using a Makefile from Michael Crawford. Thanks!
